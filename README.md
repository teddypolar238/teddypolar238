Hi, my name's Esther, or Gary for short. You may know me from such web projects as <cite>[Gary's Wod](https://garyswod.nekoweb.org)</cite>, <cite>the Roger Rogers fanpage</cite> and uhh that's where it stops. 
I want to make an Adventure Game Studio game, but I'm not so sure of the plot… or pixel art.
